            <h2>About Oniet</h2>
            <img src="https://placehold.co/200x150?text=Our+Team" alt="Placeholder image representing the Oniet team" class="image-right-float" />
            <p>Welcome to Oniet, your premier source for news with a nostalgic twist! Established in the groundbreaking year of 1999, Oniet was founded with a simple mission: to deliver the news as it was, when it was. We believe that understanding the past is key to navigating the present, and what better way to do that than through the lens of contemporary news reporting from bygone eras?</p>
            
            <p>Our dedicated team of retro-journalists scours digital archives and dusty microfilms to bring you authentic news articles, features, and op-eds from the late 20th century. From the Y2K bug persiapan to the rise of boy bands, from dial-up internet to the latest Tamagotchi craze, we cover it all with the accuracy and charm of the period.</p>

            <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p>At Oniet, we're not just about reporting old news. We're about preserving a moment in time. We believe that the way news was presented tells us as much about the era as the news itself. The slightly pixelated images, the optimistic (and sometimes wildly inaccurate) predictions about the future, the distinct writing style â€“ it's all part of the experience we aim to recreate.</p>

            <h3>Meet the (Virtual) Team</h3>
            <p>While we operate with the spirit of a bustling 1990s newsroom, our actual team is a lean group of history enthusiasts, tech nostalgics, and content curators. We are passionate about making history accessible and engaging. </p>
            <ul class="team-list">
                <li><strong>Biff Wellington:</strong> Founder & Chief Nostalgia Officer. Biff conceived Oniet after finding a box of old newspapers in his attic.</li>
                <li><strong>Brenda Switcher:</strong> Head Archivist & Lead Story Digger. If it was printed, Brenda can find it.</li>
                <li><strong>Chad Modem:</strong> Tech Guru & Digital Archaeologist. Chad keeps our 28.8k-speed-inspired website running smoothly on modern browsers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why "Oniet"?</h3>
            <p>The name "Oniet" is a playful nod to the early days of the internet, where unique and quirky names were all the rage. It sounds a bit like "on it," because we are indeed "on it" when it comes to digging up the past. Plus, it was available as a domain name back in '99, and some things are just too good to change!</p>

            <p>Thank you for visiting Oniet. We hope you enjoy your trip down memory lane. Remember to set your screen resolution to 800x600 for the most authentic experience (just kidding... or are we?).</p>
