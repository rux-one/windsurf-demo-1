## Original prompt
### Gemini 2.5 Pro

I have a very special task for you. I want you to generate a webpage that imitates the style of early 2000 webpages. One important thing is that it cannot be responsive. It's responsiveness needs to be really bad on mobile devices - this is crucial requirement. The website can imitate a news portal of that era, any images will be placeholded using https://placehold.co/600x400 and similar depending on the required image size. Website needs to have 3-5 subpages and be built using html and css. (javascript optionally but permited)

## Fixing prompt
Analyze the attached HTML5 template(s) with the following objectives:

1. **Responsiveness Analysis and Improvement**
   - Examine the current CSS and layout for any responsiveness issues (e.g., improper scaling, overflow, elements not adapting to different screen sizes).
   - Redesign or rewrite the CSS as needed to ensure the template is fully mobile-friendly and responsive, using modern best practices (such as media queries, flexible grids, rem/em units, etc.).
   - Do not alter the page content or structureâ€”only update the CSS and related styling to enhance responsiveness.

2. **Accessibility Audit and Remediation**
   - Identify any accessibility problems in the template, such as missing alt attributes, insufficient color contrast, lack of keyboard navigation, improper semantic HTML usage, or missing ARIA attributes.
   - Rectify all identified accessibility issues, making the template compliant with common accessibility standards (such as WCAG 2.1).
   - Do not change the visible content or layout beyond what is necessary for accessibility compliance.
   - Ensure web page is easily accessible for screen readers.

3. **Summary Report**
   - Provide a concise summary listing:
     - The responsiveness issues found and how they were fixed.
     - The accessibility problems identified and the specific changes made to resolve them.

Present the improved CSS (or relevant code changes) and the summary report as your output. As the final step, save the report under `report.md` in root directory.
