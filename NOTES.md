## Original prompt
### Gemini 2.5 Pro

I have a very special task for you. I want you to generate a webpage that imitates the style of early 2000 webpages. One important thing is that it cannot be responsive. It's responsiveness needs to be really bad on mobile devices - this is crucial requirement. The website can imitate a news portal of that era, any images will be placeholded using https://placehold.co/600x400 and similar depending on the required image size. Website needs to have 3-5 subpages and be built using html and css. (javascript optionally but permited)
